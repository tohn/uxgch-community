# uxgch-community

This repo is used for editing or adding content [for my
website](https://uxg.ch).

Feel free to submit changes :blush:

If you want to add new content, you can [copy the
template](./content/1649646915-template/index.md) and start from there.
If your content doesn't contain any files, it can just be a
simple `.md` file (no need for a folder).

Please add a unix timestamp at the beginning of the file:

```bash
cp content/1649646915-template/index.md content/$(date +%s)-your-new-file.md
```

Thank you very much for any edits/additions/suggestions/... :blush:
:sparkles:
